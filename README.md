Income Estimator!

Based on public U.S. census data, I created a Machine Learning model to predict whether an individual's income was over $50k per year or not. 

I used Python libraries: Pandas, Sklearn, TensorFlow, and Imbalanced Learn. 
I utilized techniques such as one-hot encoding, over-sampling, batch normalization, and dropout.

I created this project to practice and implement the machine learning principles I learned in my recent Cornell Tech Summer class! 

I am still in the process of fine-tuning my model and trying to make it as accurate as possible.
