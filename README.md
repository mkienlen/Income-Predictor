Income Estimator!

Based off of public U.S. census data, I created a Machine Learning model to predict whether an individual's income was over $50k per year or not. 

I used python libraries: Pandas, Sklearn, TensorFlow, and Imbalanced Learn. 
I utilized technique such as one-hot-encoding, over sampling, batch normalization, and dropout.

I created this project to practice and implement the machine learning principles I learned in my recent Cornell Tech Summer class!
